Analysis of Weather Data:

Latitude - Max Temperature:

    As predicted, there was a direct correlation between temperature and proximity to the equator (latitude 0 degrees).  The average and median temperature values increased as it approached 0 degree latitude, and exponentially decreased closer it got to either axis poles.  Although the correlation was obvious, there was a considerable range of error with the data.  Regions between -10 to 10 degrees had a 36 degree of error range, even if the average and median values per latitude abided by the trend of getting warmer as it approached the equator.  Breaking down the data to landlocked vs oceanic cities would have increased the accuracy of the temperature error ranges.
    
Latitude - Cloud & Humidity Coverage:

    There was far less correlation between latitude and cloud coverage/Humidity - although minor clustering did occur close to the equator where the higher temperatures would potentially increase both stats.  Likely to be a closer correlation between humidity and cloud coverage.
    
Latitude - Wind:

    Again a less than obvious correlation between latitude and wind speeds.  The max values did trend up as coordinates approached the north and south poles, but the overall median values had minimal changes.
